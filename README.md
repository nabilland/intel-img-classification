# Intel Image Classification
This project focuses on image classification using the [Intel Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). It combines a custom CNN model with transfer learning using VGG16 to classify images into different scene categories. The model integrates handcrafted convolutional layers with a pretrained VGG16 backbone to enhance feature extraction. The goal is to leverage both learned and pretrained features for improved classification accuracy.
